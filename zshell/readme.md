# Zshell configuration

## What's needed
* Well..., just install [zsh](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/zsh/) package and put the content of this folder as is in your home folder (not the readme of course)

## Notes
This was highly copied from a friend's configuration for which I dunno the github name :(
